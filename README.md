# Fraud-detection-system
Applying machine learning to identify fraudulent activities

Fraud detection systems are one of the major regions where machine learning algorithms are used extensively. The aim of this project is to build a fraud detection system using various datasets and finally end up with a bunch of efficient approaches towards that end.

# The European transactions dataset:
This is the first data set that we will be using which contains credit card transaction records for European credit cards. The following are the files related to the work on this dataset:
